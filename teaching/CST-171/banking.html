      <p>Keep the Change is a program offered by Bank of America. In this project, you're asked to create a Python program that implements the program on sample bank account data.</p>

      <p>Here's how Keep the Change works. Each purchase is rounded up to the nearest dollar and the difference is moved from your checking account to your savings account. For example, if you buy a coffee for $2.50 using your debit card, the purchase is rounded up to the nearest dollar (in this case $3) and the difference ($3 - $2.50 = 50 cents) is moved from your checking account to your savings account. Bank of America says that most people don't actively contribute to their own savings accounts. Keep the Change helps you save money without thinking about it.</p>

      <p>In this project, you'll be given a sample checking account statement listing all the purchases made over one year. Your task is to create a Python program that:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Reads the data from the provided text file</li> 
        <li>Each line of the text file contains the date the purchase was made and the amount. You are asked to split each line apart and store the date and amount in separate variables</li>
        <li>For each purchase, compute the change the change that should be moved to the savings account</li>
        <li>Keep a running total of how much has been moved to the savings account</li>
        <li>Print to the screen the total amount of money moved to the savings account</li>
        <li>Create and write to an output file where you store how much was moved on each date as well as the grand total</li>
      </ul>
